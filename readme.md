# We Rise 
**We Rise is a full stack website built during the FinTech Focus program by a team of two. This website allows registered users to recommend and access FinTech resources through CRUD operations**

**Tech Stack: Flask, Python, MongoDB, Heroku, HTML, CSS/Bootstrap**

### Features ###
- Implemented a login and sign-up system using Flask and MongoDB. Checks for an existing user in the user database and if the user does not exist, the user is prompted to register for an account
- Implemented a resource recommendation system where registered users can submit resource links and see them displayed on the website
- A report system where users can report other users for submitting inappropriate content
